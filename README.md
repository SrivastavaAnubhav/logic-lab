# logic-lab
An interactive environment for playing around with propositional logic. This accompanies my voluntary read-through of "Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Third Edition)" by Mordechai Ben-Ari.

## Scope
The motivating reason for making this was for me to play around with BDD reductions, but I might add helpful things as I go along (e.g. after writing a parser, a truth table generator is easy).
