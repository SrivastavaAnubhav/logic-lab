# logic-lab
An interactive environment for playing around with propositional logic formulas.

## Why did I do this?
I was reading "Mathematical Logic for Computer Science (Third Edition)" by Mordechai Ben-Ari and wanted to play around with [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram) reductions.
